# Pokedex
This is considered as my first full project on Android Studio. I've learnt many things from making an app like this, from 
as simple as creating adapter, xml layout, intent, using local folder, SharedPreferences, Json data, to using Volley
effectively, creating databases and many more! Overall I've spent around 1 week on this project
